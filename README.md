# CARVER.CODES - Old 3D Website
## About
I embarked on a journey to expand my skill set and knowledge by creating this website. Utilizing three.js and React, 
I delved into the realms of 3D rendering and explored the intricacies of a new framework. In addition, 
I incorporated a backend Express application equipped with Sequelize ORM to establish a database. 
This database serves the purpose of managing blog posts and storing messages, enhancing the functionality and interactivity of the site.

## Setup Instructions
Clone repository to your computer
Open Terminal 

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the "front-end" directory within your project. Run the following command `npm install` to install the client-side dependencies:
2. Once the dependencies are installed, start the app by running the following command in the same terminal: `npm start`
3. This will start the client side running on port 3000
4. Open up a web browser and navigate to localhost:3000 to run the application

***Repeat instructions for the "back-end folder in a seperate terminal***
